# Getting-a-Good-Night-s-Sleep

Sleep is essential for both physical and mental health. Quality sleep repairs cells, consolidates memories, wards off disease, and much more. In this project, you'll be working as a data science consultant for SleepInc, a sleep-tracking startup, and your mission is to analyze anonymous sleep data from their SleepScope app to uncover insights into lifestyle factors affecting sleep quality and duration.

## ðŸ’¾ The data: sleep_health_data.csv
SleepInc has provided you with an anonymized dataset of sleep and lifestyle metrics for 374 individuals. This dataset contains average values for each person calculated over the past six months. The data is saved as sleep_health_data.csv.

The dataset includes 13 columns covering sleep duration, quality, disorders, exercise, stress, diet, demographics, and other factors related to sleep health.
